# Employee Table

## About the Project
This project was a first attempt at making and deploying a react app. To streamline the construction of the application, I used Material UI's sorting table and then built my own logic to connect the table data to the randomized employee data pulled from the Random User Generator API. I also made a text field to filter the table by first or last name.
